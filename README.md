# Pokémon Team Checker

This repository contains a simple web application designed to check the validity and synergy of a Pokémon team.

**Please Note:** This project is primarily an exercise in data handling and front-end development. It is **not intended for production use** and does not prioritize security, scalability, or robust web application principles. If you're looking for a production-ready application, this is not it.

However, if you're interested in seeing how data can be fetched, processed, and displayed in a basic web interface, feel free to explore the code!
